# CSS Animation - Animated Carousel

In this project, we build an animated carousel that slides every 4 seconds. Three visible of carousel items are shown from 8 total items. Pips denoting the current, previous and next slides displayed below carousel. You can jump to any index of slide by selecting the pip. You can also navigate to previous and next slides from carousel window by clicking on previous or next slide. Once that happens, the slide will pause for 10 seconds to allow more reading time before the slides start to animate.

We leverage JavaScript to loop animation of the carousel as well as respond to user interaction when carousel is clicked or pip is selected. Different class hooks are added to carousel items based on their position indices. These class hooks contain transition properties that drives carousel animation.
